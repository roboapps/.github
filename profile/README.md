## Challenge: The Everyday Robots

Creating robots that can be taught by anyone requires tackling some of the hardest challenges in the field of robotics. The Everyday Robot Project is developing a general-purpose learning robot that can operate autonomously in unstructured environments

Today, robots are expensive and perform highly specialized tasks. But what if a robot could be affordable and taught by just about anyone? They could help people with whatever they needed, doing tasks we haven't even dreamed up yet.

Building robots that can operate autonomously in unstructured human environments and all terrains, like our homes, offices and outdoors, is a complex, unsolved problem. It requires tackling and integrating some of the hardest hardware and software challenges in the field of robotics today. The Everyday Robot Project is building a new type of learning robot â€” one that can eventually learn to help everyone, every day.
